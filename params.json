In the case of an RSS feed you would specify the URL of the RSS feed.\r\n\r\nWhen you POST the server first checks if the urls you specifed are returning an [HTTP 2xx status code](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.2) then it attempts to notify the subscriber of an update to make sure it works.  This is done in one of two ways.\r\n\r\n1. If you did not specify a domain parameter and we're using the requesting IP address we perform a POST request to the URL represented by `http://<ip>:<port><path>` with a single parameter `url`. To accept the subscription that resource just needs to return an HTTP 2xx status code.\r\n2. If you did specify a domain parameter then we perform a GET request to the URL represented by `http://<domain>:<port><path>` with two query string parameters, url and challenge. To accept the subscription that resource needs to return an HTTP 2xx status code and have the challenge value as the response body.\r\n\r\nYou will receive a response with two values:\r\n\r\n1. success -- true or false depending on whether or not the subscription suceeded\r\n2. msg -- a string that explains either that you succeed or why it failed\r\n\r\nThe default response type is text/xml but if you POST with an [accept header](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.1) specifying `application/json` we will return a JSON formatted response.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\r\n<notifyResult success=\"false\" msg=\"The subscription was cancelled because the call failed when we tested the handler.\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\"success\":false,\"msg\":\"The subscription was cancelled because the call failed when we tested the handler.\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### POST /ping\r\n\r\nPosting to /ping is your way of alerting the server that a resource has been updated. \r\n\r\nThe POST parameters are:\r\n\r\n1. url\r\n\r\nWhen you POST the server first checks if the url has actually changed since the last time it checked.  If it has, it will go through it's list of subscribers and POST to the subscriber with the parameter `url`.\r\n\r\nThe default response type is text/xml but if you POST with an [accept header](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.1) specifying `application/json` we will return a JSON formatted response.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\r\n<notifyResult success=\"true\" msg=\"Thanks for the ping.\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\"success\":true,\"msg\":\"Thanks for the ping.\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### GET /pingForm\r\n\r\nThe path /pingForm is an HTML form intented to allow you to ping via a web browser.\r\n\r\n### GET /viewLog\r\n\r\nThe path /viewLog is a log of recent events that have occured on the server. It's very useful if you're trying to debug your tools.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
